ðŸ§  Simon Game
Simon is a classic memory-based game that challenges players to repeat an ever-growing sequence of lights and sounds. The game features four colored buttonsâ€”ðŸŸ¥ Red, ðŸŸ© Green, ðŸŸ¦ Blue, and ðŸŸ¨ Yellowâ€”each with its own unique tone.

ðŸŽ® How It Works
Simon plays a sequence by lighting up buttons and playing sounds.

The player must replicate the sequence in the correct order.

With each round, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.

A mistake ends the game.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Test and improve your memory by following the sequence for as long as possible!
